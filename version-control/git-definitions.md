# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file so that you can recall specific versions later.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of your project where you make changes safely and your team members who work on the same project could validate the changes.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A good commit message should be about what a commit does, not what it did.
* What is a merge conflict?
 Merge conflicts are when two branches cannot be sucessfully merge together because the files have been changed since the original branch was made
